# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This is a learning project that focuses on analyzing telecom customer churn using a dataset containing various customer attributes and churn status. The goal is to identify key factors influencing churn and provide insights to help telecom companies improve customer retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following attributes:
- Customer ID
- Gender
- Senior Citizen (Yes/No)
- Partner (Yes/No)
- Dependents (Yes/No)
- Tenure (months)
- Phone Service (Yes/No)
- Multiple Lines (Yes/No/No phone service)
- Internet Service (DSL, Fiber optic, No)
- Online Security (Yes/No/No internet service)
- Online Backup (Yes/No/No internet service)
- Device Protection (Yes/No/No internet service)
- Tech Support (Yes/No/No internet service)
- Streaming TV (Yes/No/No internet service)
- Streaming Movies (Yes/No/No internet service)
- Contract (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)
- Paperless Billing (Yes/No)
- Payment Method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer (automatic), Credit card (automatic))
- Monthly Charges
- Total Charges
- Churn (Yes/No)

## Analysis
The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and visualize relationships between variables. Key insights from the analysis include:
- Churn Rate: Approximately 26.6% of customers churned.
- Contract Type: Month-to-month contracts are associated with higher churn rates compared to longer-term contracts.
- Payment Method: Customers using electronic checks have higher churn rates.
- Internet Service: Fiber optic customers exhibit higher churn rates compared to DSL or no internet service customers.
- Tenure: New customers are more likely to churn compared to long-term customers.

## Methodology
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and address any inconsistencies in the data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize distributions, relationships, and correlations between variables.
- Statistical Analysis: Conduct hypothesis testing or statistical modeling if required to validate findings.
- Visualization: Utilize visualizations such as heatmaps, bar charts, and histograms to communicate insights effectively.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into factors influencing customer churn in the telecom industry. To reduce churn and improve customer retention, telecom companies should focus on improving service quality, offering attractive contract terms, providing better payment options, and addressing specific pain points identified in the analysis. By understanding customer behavior and preferences, telecom companies can implement targeted retention strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately leading to improved business performance and profitability.

## Future Work
- Implement predictive modeling techniques to forecast customer churn.
- Incorporate external data sources such as customer feedback and market trends for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Continuously monitor churn rates and customer feedback to iterate and improve retention strategies over time.
